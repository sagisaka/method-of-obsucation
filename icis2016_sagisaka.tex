\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
Recently, illegalities such as illegality access and analysis are increasing.
Various methods of protection in software are proposed as a measure.
Method of protection in software can guard from the injustice access and analysis by prevent the program in advance.
There is a method of protection called obfuscation that is one of the method of protection in software.
The obfuscation is method of protection so as not to analyze program.
%
For example, name obfuscation that is to change unknown name of meaning into class name and method name and control flow of obfuscation that is to generate code that is not able to understand the meaning when de-compile is tried to do are proposed various methods how we falsify data so as not to analyze.
There are the methods called de-obfuscation that is to return obfuscation program to original program.
As de-obfuscation is taken by illegality access, the measure is need.
We consider useful in analyzing for malware that is protecting obfuscation by doing research to de-obfuscation.
So, we consider new measure for obfuscation and discussion about vulnerability of obfuscation.
However, the research about de-obfuscation do not ever take for the present.
For taking the de-obfuscation, it takes to identify the used obfuscation from various obfuscation and needs to make sure how to analyze.
Then, in this paper, we analyze the obfuscated program and search the characteristic of method of obfuscation.
In specific, we analyze the command of software ( jar file ) that is applied method of obfuscation, and get to estimation of creation in each n-gram of opcode as preliminary experiment.
We compare their results and extract characteristic.
After that, we inspect the efficiency for unknown product and unknown method of obfuscation from extracted characteristic as evaluation experiment.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure

% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column

\section{Related Work}
Method of protection in software can separate methods into three technique groups that is (1) prevention of plagiarism, (2) detection of plagiarism, and (3) identification of plagiarism.\cite{collberg09surreptitious}
(1) as obfuscation methods and anti-de-assemble methods\cite{tyma00patent,monden97ieice}, (2) as bath mark in software methods\cite{tamada05ieice},and (3) as watermark in software methods mainly researched\cite{collberg99popl}.

Methods of attack are proposed for obfuscation with a factor technique of (1).
One of them is de-change for name obfuscation that is to change the variable name and function name into programs for hard reading\cite{cimato05jss}.
The other one is to classify method for using the abstract syntax tree for applied program with obfuscation method that is to complicate the control flow.
Both methods are useful to establish as methods of attack.
On the other hand, for specializing obfuscation, the method is not general.
Established methods of attack that are bath mark that are a factor technique of (2) and (3) and watermark do not exist.
However, base mark and watermark have common points that is to use the information in program.
That is to say, as their methods are to change the information in reference program, these methods will become to the methods of attack.
For that reason, obfuscation methods with a factor technique of (1) is used as methods of attack\cite{tian13hpcc}.
On the other hand, the methods that is to evaluate unnatural from methods of protect as method of evaluation with obfuscations are proposed\cite{kanzaki14ipsj}.
There is method that is to estimate unnatural from methods of protect by the probability of creations that is to abstract n-gram from opcode in programs.
Kanzaki's method is to evaluate the artificial of degree between opcode that is applied by method of protection and opcode that is to do output by compiler.

\section{Proposed method}

\subsection{key idea}
As Methods of protection have various methods, various methods carry out the change of program.
The change is carried out the characteristic management to hide the informations that are to notice various methods.
For example, as the name in program ( a variable name, method name, and class name etc ) have meaning to contribute for understanding program,
name obfuscation\cite{tyma00patent} protects program to change the name that is difficult and no-meaning.
This obfuscation methods are gotten characteristic by methods that is to change the every name.

The name obfuscations such as method that the name is changed one of alphabet, invisibility word such as space and tab, reserved name, repeat name\cite{dasho}, and not only definition part of name but also using part of hiding are proposed various methods\cite{tamada07ieice}. 

However, as these name obfuscation carried out obfuscation, it become to be seen the characteristic that is to see various methods to name in program.
That is to say, the case of name obfuscation is able to identify that every name obfuscation is applied by observing the name.
Even other method of protect, they are able to hope to be reflected the characteristics of method of protect to program in after change.
So, we try to identify method of obfuscation by analyzing characteristic of program in after change.

Base mark that is to distinguish others programs by characteristic in program is proposed.
Base mark is technique that is to find plagiarism by comparing characteristic with ones that program have originally.
For difference purpose from this research, it can not apply the base mark as it is, but it can expect the advance method of base mark as standard way of comparison.
Kanzaki's propose method that is to evaluate unnatural of program.
This program is to expect n-gram from opcode in program and to evaluate unnatural by requiring generative probability.
For example, Matuda's evaluate difficult discovery of method of protection by comparing unnatural of fragment of code.
We assume that method of protection have a proper characteristic by forcing on this method.
Thus, for proper characteristic, we try to identify how method of protection are used.
If method of protection can be identified, specializing method of attack for  and attack for the method of protection understanding to method of protection are possible.
Conversely, if method of protection can not be identified, the key of attack can not be taken  and attack is difficult.
It show a schematic diagram of method of protection at Figure 3.1.
Process method and base mark are same as processing that is to extract characteristic from protected program.
On the other hand, evaluation point are different.

In Figure 3.1, protected program p1 p2 are gotten by method of protection f1 f2 with how program are protected.

\subsection{summary}
Some characteristic in method of protection have become clear by preliminary experiment.
This purpose is how to decide the method of protection from extracted characteristic.
As extracting characteristic is based on n-gram of opcode such as 
chapter three, verse 2, 
we compare its with perplexity and frequency.

we conducted a preliminary study to investigate the following questions.
RQ1: What kind of characteristic in method of obfuscation? 

RQ2-1:Is the characteristic effective measure for unknown product?

RQ2-2:Is the characteristic effective measure for unknown obfuscation?

\subsection{analysis in n-gram}
In this purpose, we analyzed order in n-gram by referring to frequency and perplexity in each method of obfuscation.
In the analysis result, It see different order before and after protection in method of obfuscation.

As a result, we analyze the RQ1.

Also, we understand that added order is high value of perplexity and rare order.
For these data, added order
As characteristic in method of obfuscation is added order by these datas, the characteristic are reported TABLE\ref{table:features}.

\subsection{identifying method of obfuscation in known}
In this purpose, unknown product are obfuscated by using the tools in TABLE\ref{table:features}, after we identify how method of obfuscation are used.

As a result, we analyze the RQ2-1.

Not appearing n-gram are researched by n-gram that is before applied obfuscation.
In the result, n-gram of high frequency in five is reported TABLE\ref{table:junit}.
In showing the TABLE\ref{table:junit}, the order are called high value in perplexity such as dup2X2 lxor.
As the order is characteristic, we compare it with characteristic in five tool ( TABLE\ref{table:junit} ).
As a result, characteristic in applied method of obfuscation correspond with characteristic in method of MLI.

\subsection{identifying method of obfuscation in unknown}
In this purpose, known products are obfuscated by using the unknown method of obfuscation, after we identify how method of obfuscation are used.

As a result, we analyze the RQ2-2.

Not appearing n-gram are researched by n-gram that is before applied obfuscation.
In the result, n-gram of high frequency in five is reported TABLE\ref{table:jhstop}.
In showing the TABLE\ref{table:jhstop}, the order that is high value in perplexity are called dup and imul orders in continuous.
As the order is characteristic, we compare it with characteristic in five tool ( TABLE\ref{table:jhstop} ).
As a result, characteristic in unknown method of obfuscation do not correspond with characteristic in analyzed method.

In the next, as difference product are obfuscated unknown method of obfuscation, we compare the each characteristic.
As a result, as the same characteristic are identified, we understand that unknown method of product is method of SOP.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we took the identification of method of protection by watching the unnatural evaluation.
The actual program was applied method of protection and extracted characteristic to base on frequency and perplexity to order line of n-gram.
In this evaluation experiment, the identification of known obfuscation is easy and the identification of unknown obfuscation is difficult.
This solution plan is to increase the characteristic of method of obfuscation.
it can respond to method of unknown obfuscation by increasing characteristic.
